A (unofficial) WordPress plugin to report PHP errors and JavaScript errors to Sentry.

== Description ==
This plugin can report PHP errors (optionally) and JavaScript errors (optionally) to Sentry and integrates with its release tracking.

It will auto detect authenticated users and add context where possible. All context/tags can be adjusted/expanded using filters.

_For more information and documentation have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/blob/v3.10.0/README.md) file._

== Installation ==
1. Install this plugin by cloning or copying this repository to your `wp-contents/plugins` folder
2. Configure your DSN as explained below
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface

_For more information and documentation have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/blob/v3.10.0/README.md) file._

**Note:** this plugin does not do anything by default and has only a admin interface to test the integration. A Sentry DSN must be configured in your `wp-config.php`.

(Optionally) track PHP errors by adding this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `PHP_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN', 'PHP_DSN' );`

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the PHP tracker.

**Note:** This constant was previously called `WP_SENTRY_DSN` and is still supported.

(Optionally) set the error types the PHP tracker will track:

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_ERROR_TYPES', E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED );`

(Optionally) If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information is added by active integrations. Without this flag they are never added to the event, to begin with.

If possible, itâ€™s recommended to turn on this feature and use the server side PII stripping to remove the values instead.

When enabled the current logged in user and IP address will be added to the event.

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII', true );`

(Optionally) track JavaScript errors by adding this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `JS_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN', 'JS_DSN' );`

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the JavaScript tracker.

**Note:** This constant was previously called `WP_SENTRY_PUBLIC_DSN` and is still supported.

(Optionally) define a version of your site; by default the theme version will be used. This is used for tracking at which version of your site the error occurred. When combined with release tracking this is a very powerful feature.

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_VERSION', 'v3.10.0' );`

(Optionally) define an environment of your site. Defaults to `unspecified`.

`define( 'WP_SENTRY_ENV', 'production' );`
